## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions

> Fall season seems to have attracted more booking. And, in each season the booking count has increased drastically from 2018 to 2019.
> Most of the bookings has been done during the month of may, june, july, aug, sep and oct.Trend increased starting of the year tillmid of the year and then it started decreasing as we approached the end of year. Number of booking for each month seems to have increased from 2018 to 2019.
> Clear weather attracted more booking which seems obvious. And in comparison to previous year, i.e 2018, booking increased for each weather situation in 2019.
> Thu, Fir, Sat and Sun have more number of bookings as compared to the start of the week.
> Thu, Fir, Sat and Sun have more number of bookings as compared to the start of the week.
> Booking seemed to be almost equal either on working day or non-working day. But, the count increased from 2018 to 2019.
> 2019 attracted more number of booking from the previous year, which shows good progress in terms of business.

> Comparision between Training and Testing dataset:
- Train dataset R^2 : 0.833
- Test dataset R^2 : 0.8038
- Train dataset Adjusted R^2 : 0.829
- Test dataset Adjusted R^2 : 0.7944
> Demand of bikes depend on year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer and winter.
